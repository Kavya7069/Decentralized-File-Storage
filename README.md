# Decentralized File Storage and Secure File Management


This project is a Decentralized File Storage and Secure Data Management System that leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure, reliable, and efficient way to store and manage files. It ensures data integrity, security, and user privacy by distributing files across a decentralized network.


# Key Features

 - Distributed Storage: Files are stored across a decentralized network, ensuring redundancy and data availability.
 -  Enhanced Security: Blockchainâ€™s inherent security features protect data from breaches and unauthorized access.
 - Immutable Records: The immutability of the blockchain ensures the integrity and authenticity of stored files.
 -  User Control: Users have full control over their data, enhancing privacy and ownership.


## Getting Started
**Installation:**

 - Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - Open one terminal and start server/peer: `python server.py`
 - Open another terminal and start a client: `python run_app.py`
 - Copy the link from the client terminal, `http://localhost:9000`, paste it in any browser
