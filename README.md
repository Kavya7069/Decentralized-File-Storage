Decentralized File Storage

Overview:
  This project is a Decentralized File Storage and Secure Data Management System that leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure, reliable, and efficient way to store and manage files. It ensures data integrity, security, and user privacy by distributing files across a decentralized network.

Key Features:
  Distributed Storage: Files are stored across a decentralized network, ensuring redundancy and data availability.
  Enhanced Security: Blockchainâ€™s inherent security features protect data from breaches and unauthorized access.
  Immutable Records: The immutability of the blockchain ensures the integrity and authenticity of stored files.
  User Control: Users have full control over their data, enhancing privacy and ownership.
Real-World Applications:
  Personal Cloud Storage: Secure and private file storage for individuals.
  Document Verification: Tamper-proof verification and timestamping of important documents.
  Supply Chain Management: Transparent tracking of goods throughout the supply chain.
  Healthcare: Secure transfer and storage of sensitive patient data.
  Legal and Financial Services: Confidential handling of sensitive documents.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
Flask
requests
cryptography

Installation:
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Kavya7069/Decentralized-File-Storage
cd decentralized-file-storage

Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

Start the Flask server:
bash
Copy code
python server.py
python run_app.py

Open your web browser and navigate to:
plaintext
Copy code
http://localhost:9000

How It Works:
File Upload: Users upload files through the web interface.
File Encryption: The uploaded files are encrypted using symmetric encryption before being stored.
Distributed Storage: Encrypted files are stored across a decentralized network.
Blockchain Integration: Metadata and access controls are managed using blockchain technology.

Future Enhancements
Integration with IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for more efficient distributed storage.
Implementing user authentication and access controls using blockchain-based identity management.
Adding support for more file types and larger file sizes.
